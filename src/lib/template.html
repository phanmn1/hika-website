        <div>Have you owned and/or raised a puppy before? If so, please tell me about your past or current dog(s) or any other pet you have owned? If not, please discuss with me what your plans to train a young puppy and know what to expect. If you haven&#39;t owned or raised a puppy before I'd be happy to help.</div>
        <div>Who will be the primary caregiver?</div>
        <div>What do you expect from your breeder?</div>
        <div>What kind of property do you reside in and since when have you resided there?</div>
        <div>If you are renting can you show proof of permission from owner?</div>
        <div>Do you have a garden? Is it properly fenced? (If you don't have a yard, that's fine too!)</div>
        <div>How long daily will the Cavalier be left alone at home?</div>
        <div>How many adults and kids are in the household and what are kids ages?</div>
        <div>Do they all agree to have a cavalier?</div>
        <div>Explain your home schedules and routines</div>
        <div>On holidays, how are you planning to care for your Cavalier? (I plan to have Cavaliers from my breeding to be able to board in my home for owners who have bought a dog from me but at reasonable cost. I do not recommend dog boarding facilities where all types of dogs are lumped in together. Best would be a family member or trusted friend being able to take care of your Cavalier where they are familiar.)</div>
        <div>Have you ever returned a pet to the breeder, given a pet away, or taken to a shelter? If so, please explain.</div>
        <div>Who will be your permanent veterinarian? (You will need to take the puppy to one in the first 48 hours you bring the puppy home).</div>
        <div>How would you manage if there is a behavior problem with your puppy?</div>
        <div>Waht do you expect from your companion dog?</div>
        <div>Are you planning to take your puppy to training classes and give much of your time into training your new puppy? What are your plans to train your Cavalier?</div>
        <div>Do you understand that a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is a companion dog and is to be kept as primarily indoor dogs and are not fit as outdoor guard dogs?</div>
        <div>Are you willing to pay the higher cost for a good-quality food for your cavalier? (This is essential to keep this specific breed healthy and live a longer life).</div>
        <div>Pet dogs are not allowed to breed. Does this cause a problem?</div>
        <div>Do you understand that puppies from my program will be on a spay/neuter contract and sold with a limited AKC registration due to the dog being a companion specimen to avoid those who follow puppy mill practices who ignore the many years of statistical research and specialist recommendations for the health and care of the Cavalier. (To ethically and properly conserve any breed, there is a lot of knowledge and a lot of commitment, time, and investments into doing the best work we can to breed the healthiest dogs and to best represent the breed per the breed standard. Very rarely I will give full registration for show prospects and to knowledgable owners I really trust that truly care for the breed. Please let me know if you want to touch more on this topic).</div>
