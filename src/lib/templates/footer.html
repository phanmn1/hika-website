    <sup>[1]</sup> I plan to have Cavaliers from my breeding to be able to board in my home for owners who have bought a dog from me but at reasonable cost. I do not recommend dog boarding facilities where all types of dogs are lumped in together. Best would be a family member or trusted friend being able to take care of your Cavalier where they are familiar.

  <div id="akc" class="note-item">
    <sup>[2]</sup> Due to the dog being a companion specimen to avoid those who follow puppy mill practices who ignore the many years of statistical research and specialist recommendations for the health and care of the Cavalier. (To ethically and properly conserve any breed, there is a lot of knowledge and a lot of commitment, time, and investments into doing the best work we can to breed the healthiest dogs and to best represent the breed per the breed standard. Very rarely I will give full registration for show prospects and to knowledgable owners I really trust that truly care for the breed. Please let me know if you want to touch more on this topic).
