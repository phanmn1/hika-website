        <p>“I don’t like dogs. I LOVE dogs.” </p>
        <br/>
        <p>Hi, my name is Hikari Watanabe! Born in Japan, raised in Oahu, went to college in California, and planned to settle down in Oregon until a tragic but a now common happening called cancer fell upon my mother who was still in Hawaii while I was off on my own ventures.  I ultimately made the decision to fully move back to Hawaii to support and help her as much as I can after learning more about this cancer knowing that it will be a long battle. This move back to Hawaii also ultimately changed much of my life path which led me into following my passion that would allow me to work in something I absolutely love while also being there for my mother. When it comes to following my passion, this means my love for dogs ever since I can remember. Some may even say dog-obsessed, since I would surround myself with anything dog-related such as dog textbooks about breed standards, drawing and painting dogs whenever I could, collecting dog blankets, curtains, accessories, researching about dogs, going to any dog-related events I could go to, and talking about dogs wherever I could from when I was very little. I’ve owned a variety of different animals through out my life and am a total animal nerd. With that being said, the main focus to my breeding program is that I am and will always strive to do my best to be a breeder who can provide this amazing breed to others here in the way how I wish for all breeders to put all the effort and due diligence possible to show true care for the future of my dogs, their puppies, as well as their prospective owners. It is extremely hard to find anybody who checks all the marks but I will strive my best to check all those marks that I wished to find in a breeder when I was searching for a Cavalier. </p>

          <p>Health details in our Cavaliers are of utmost importance. 
This includes having all of our dogs professionally tested for their:
<br/>
<br/>
<ul className="list-disc">
  <li>Heart (for MVD or mitral valve disease)</li>
  <li>Eyes (for eye disorders)</li>
  <li>Patellas (for patellar luxation or loose knees)</li>
</ul>
<br/>
They are also DNA tested and clear for:
<br/>
<br/>
<ul className="list-disc">
  <li>CC (Curly Coat)</li>
  <li>DE (Dry Eye Syndrome)</li>
  <li>EFS (Episodic Falling Syndrome)</li>
  <li>MD (Muscular Dystrophy)</li>
</ul>
<br/>
which are all extremely harmful for them. Please go to my resources page to educate yourself more on these conditions to understand why these are very important to know about before owning a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. Educating yourself thoroughly in the breed you want is the first step to finding the right puppy and choosing a reputable breeder who truly cares for the breed they focus on. 
<br/><br/>
Our Cavaliers are registered in AKC and CKCSC-USA which are the two only legitimate registries in the U.S. for cavaliers.  The CKCSC-USA has a code of ethics which each member must follow. The puppies we produce are well-bred and raised as family to be well-socialized, friendly, playful, and just overall amazing companions. I breed for quality in health, correct temperament, & comformation to the standard of the breed. Once you own a cavalier, you will understand and feel the difference of the immense love a cavalier can give you. I’ve owned a few different breeds from a chihuahua to a mini american sheperd but until I owned my first cavalier, it felt like I found true love in a dog that I’ve never experienced. Something about how their adorable “melty” eyes reflect your gaze and can soothe your soul is definitely a super-power I believe they have.
