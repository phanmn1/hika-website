As responsible Cavalier fanciers and hobby breeders, we adhere to ethical breeding practices and follow all applicable regulations and guidelines to promote the health and longevity of the Cavalier breed. We carefully select our breeding dogs, ensuring they possess the desirable traits that define the Cavalier breed, including their gentle nature and affectionate disposition.  We also prioritize early socialization, exposing our puppies to various stimuli and experiences to help them grow into confident and well-adjusted companions who will bring years of happiness & cherished memories.
